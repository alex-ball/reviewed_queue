# reviewed_queue
This package creates a queue for reviewed items where publication of the metadata is pending an external trigger. This has arisen from the use case of datasets, where checking and validation of the content does not mean the record is ready to be published. Managing this from within the "Under Review" section becomes unwieldy, and there is a risk of items being missed for validation. The plugin provides an additional status, screen and actions to move an item to "reviewed" which allows repository managers to check an item's contents and then put it aside for future publication.
